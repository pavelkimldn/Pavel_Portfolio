# **[Analyzing Commodity Price Trends and Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/commodities_analysis)**

- The project aims to analyze historical commodity price trends and develop predictive models using Python to forecast future prices, focusing on Gold.
- The dataset includes daily prices from 2000 to March 2022, with columns such as Commodity, Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Missing values were handled through forward filling.
- Visualized price trends over time and calculated 50-day and 200-day moving averages to highlight short-term and long-term trends.
- Moving averages were used to provide a clearer view of trends and smooth out short-term fluctuations, aiding in identifying potential buy/sell signals.
- Applied the ARIMA model to predict future prices, evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and extended predictions to forecast prices until 2030.
- Utilized Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling.

# **[Emotion Detection with Computer Vision](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Computer_Vision_Live_Emotion_Detection)**

- Provide companies with a valuable tool for enhancing various operations, particularly during business meetings.
- Enable recording of video footage or live emotion detection during meetings to gauge overall mood and sentiment.
- Assist managers in accurately assessing meeting success based on detected emotions.
- Evaluate team members' performance by analyzing emotional responses during interactions.
- Extend utility by integrating the model into existing CCTV systems for real-time emotion detection among employees.
- Serve as a versatile tool for enhancing decision-making processes, fostering better communication, and optimizing workplace dynamics.

# **[Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/monte_carlo_stock_price)**

- Simulate future stock prices to estimate potential distributions for financial analysis and risk assessment.
- Data Collection: Fetch historical stock prices using yfinance (e.g., JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPM).
- Monte Carlo Simulation: Calculate returns, compute statistical parameters, and perform multiple simulations over 252 trading days.
- Line Plot of Simulations: Show simulated stock price paths over 252 days to illustrate possible outcomes.
- Include a histogram of final prices and a confidence interval plot to show price variability.

# **[S&P 500 Data Visualisation](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Data_Visualisation_S-P500_2022)**

- Analyze financial metrics of S&P 500 companies to understand sector-wise distributions and investment implications.
- Dataset includes 14 columns with financial metrics like price, PE ratio, dividend yield, EPS, 52-week highs/lows, market cap, EBITDA, PS, and PB.
- Used histograms, scatter plots, box plots, 3D scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize data and interpret relationships.
- Found stock price concentrations, price-EPS relationships, and sectoral dividend yield variations, with Telecommunication Services showing the highest median yield.
- Visualizations help investors make informed decisions by highlighting sector differences, aiding in identifying growth, stability, or income opportunities.

# **[Cyber Security Port Scanner](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Cyber_Security_Port_Scanner)**

- Develope a simple port scanner to identify open ports on a given IP address range.
- Port Scanner assists in network security assessments by discovering potential vulnerabilities.
- Port scanner scans a specified range of ports on a given IP address.
- Logs scanning results for analysis.
- Simulated scanning multiple IP addresses to generate comprehensive data.

# **[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculator](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/discounted_cash_flow_calculator/tree/main)**

- Tool for calculating DCF and NPV for investment decisions.
- Uses projected cash flows, discount rates, terminal value, and initial investment.
- Plots cash flows, present values, cumulative DCF, and terminal value with Matplotlib.
- Displays DCF, NPV values, and investment recommendation.
- User friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).

# **[Predicting Luxury Watch Prices with an MLP model](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Luxury_Watches_MLP)**

- Compare K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for AAPL closing price prediction.
- Preprocess data: Select features, split dataset, and scale features.
- Train models: KNN with 5 neighbors, SVM with linear kernel.
- Evaluate models: Compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and perform cross-validation.
- Visualize results: Plot actual vs predicted prices, error distribution histograms, scatter plots, and learning curves.
